# Task_3
# SQL Operations on E-commerce Dataset (MySQL Workbench Project)

This project showcases a series of SQL operations performed on an E-commerce dataset using MySQL Workbench. The goal was to explore, analyze, and optimize data for meaningful insights.
All tasks were executed using SQL queries, and screenshots of the execution and results are included in this repository for reference

Tasks Performed:

Basic SQL Queries
Used SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY clauses to explore data and filter based on customer behavior, product category, and order priority.

JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
Simulated joining the orders table with hypothetical customers and products tables to demonstrate different types of joins and their outputs.

Subqueries
Used subqueries to extract specific data insights, such as orders with sales above average, high-profit orders, and more.

Aggregate Functions
Calculated totals and averages using SUM() and AVG() for sales, profits, and discounts to perform sales performance analysis.

Views for Analysis
Created reusable views like HighPriorityOrders and ProductCategorySalesSummary for easier analysis of high-priority orders and category-wise performance.

Indexes for Optimization
Added indexes on frequently used columns (Customer_Id, Product_Category, Order_Priority, Payment_method) to improve query speed and optimize performance.

Also demonstrated multi-column indexes and explained indexing strategy.

Dataset Attributes Used
Order_Date, Time, Aging, Customer_Id, Gender, Device_Type, Customer_Login_type Product_Category, Product, Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit, Shipping_Cost Order_Priority, Payment_method

Screenshots
Screenshots of all the tasks and query outputs have been included in this repository to visualize and document the work done using MySQL Workbench.
